# üó∫Ô∏è Magik GIS Utility Scripts

## üìå Overview
This repository contains a collection of **Magik programming scripts** developed for **Smallworld GIS** to support network design, data quality, and automation tasks in telecom and utility projects.

The scripts are organized into three main project categories:

- **CPM** ‚Äì Cable Plant Management utilities
- **CV** ‚Äì CV data tools
- **GDO** ‚Äì Gas Distribution Office migration utilities

These scripts were used to automate repetitive processes, improve data accuracy, and generate reports in GIS environments.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About Magik
**Magik** is an object-oriented programming language used primarily within **GE Smallworld GIS** ‚Äî a platform widely adopted in **telecommunications**, **utilities**, and **infrastructure** industries.  
It is designed for geospatial data processing and network modeling, enabling engineers to:
- Automate mapping tasks
- Integrate spatial and attribute data
- Perform network analysis and reporting
- Enforce data quality standards

In telecom and utility projects, Magik scripts often run inside Smallworld GIS to streamline workflows and ensure accurate, consistent spatial data.
